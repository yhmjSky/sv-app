Whenever you want to ask a question, always call the MCP interactive_feedback.
Whenever youâ€™re about to complete a user request, call the MCP interactive_feedback instead of simply ending the process.
Only when the feedback is empty or the user actively requests to end it, you can end the request without calling MCP again.

Note! Normally, you will call MCP interactive_feedback several times
